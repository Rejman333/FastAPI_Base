# FastAPI_Base

FastAPI_Base is a boilerplate project designed to help developers kick-start new applications using FastAPI. The primary goal of this project was to deepen understanding of the FastAPI framework and to create a reusable, ready-to-go base setup for future projects.

This project integrates a preconfigured development environment with essential tools and services commonly used in modern web applications.

### Features
* FastAPI for building fast and efficient APIs

* PostgreSQL integration with ORM for persistent storage

* Redis for caching and session/token management

* Authentication framework ready for expansion

* Project structure designed for scalability and maintainability

* Work in progress â€” some components are still under development

### Purpose

The idea behind this project was to:
- Learn the internals and best practices of FastAPI
- Explore how to combine it with production-ready tools (Postgres, Redis, etc.)
- Provide a solid, reusable base for future backend services
    

While the work has currently been paused, the existing implementation can already serve as a foundation for new projects.
